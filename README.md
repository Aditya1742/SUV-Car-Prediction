# SUV-Car-Prediction
Overview:

This project aims to predict whether a person will purchase an SUV based on features like age and estimated salary. The prediction is made using a supervised machine learning model â€” Logistic Regression.

Dataset:

The dataset includes:

Gender

Age

Estimated Salary

Purchased (Target variable)


Steps Followed:

1. Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.


2. Data Visualization:
Used graphs and plots to understand the distribution of data, correlations, and patterns between features and the target variable.


3. Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate model performance fairly.


4. Model Training:
Trained a Logistic Regression model using the training data.


5. Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model on the test data using accuracy score to measure how well the model predicts new outcomes.



Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

Results:

The model achieved a good accuracy score and successfully identifies individuals who are more likely to purchase an SUV.

Future Enhancements:

Try other classification models like SVM, KNN, or Random Forest

Include more features for better predictions

Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask for user interaction
